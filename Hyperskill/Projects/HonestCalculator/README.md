<h1>Stage 1</h1>

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>We will start by implementing the flowchart below. Copy the messages carefully and assign them to the program variables. It makes no difference whether you make a list or each message is a separate variable. The appropriate messages must be displayed according to the flowchart. </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" height="612" name="Stage1.jpg" src="https://ucarecdn.com/b1770719-2eea-4389-b126-9fbd2edf8d96/" width="623"/></p>
<p><strong>Objectives</strong></p>
<p>Implement the flowchart above. Please, follow our recommendations:</p>
<ul>
<li>The variable <code class="java">calc</code> should have the following format: <code class="java">x operation y</code>. For example: <code class="java">2 + 3</code>, <code class="java">2 + g</code> or <code class="java">3.1 r 5</code>;</li>
<li>The variables <code class="java">x</code> and <code class="java">y</code> must be of the <code class="java">float</code> or <code class="java">int</code> type. The <code class="java">oper</code> variable is a one-character string. Check whether the passed values have proper types. The delimiter must be a dot;</li>
<li>Don't use the built-in <code class="java">eval()</code> function to calculate from a string, please! It'll be much more useful to you if you try to apply the tools you've learned in theory and practice to use them for specific tasks;</li>
<li>Copy the messages below carefully. The tests will check if the correct message appears in the correct order. Please, do not add extra lines or characters.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="java">msg_0 = "Enter an equation"

msg_1 = "Do you even know what numbers are? Stay focused!"

msg_2 = "Yes ... an interesting math operation. You've slept through all classes, haven't you?"</code></pre>
<p> </p>

<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Enter an equation
&gt; 2 + m
Do you even know what numbers are? Stay focused!
Enter an equation
&gt; 3 n 3
Yes ... an interesting math operation. You've slept through all classes, haven't you?
Enter an equation
&gt; m - 2
Do you know what the numbers are? Stay focused!
Enter an equation
&gt; 4.7 * 5.2</code></pre></body></html>

<h1>Stage 2</h1>

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>In this stage, we will continue with the flowchart. Note that the blocks from the previous stage are in red. Be careful; some flows can work differently.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" height="1152" name="Stage2.jpg" src="https://ucarecdn.com/14a82832-1487-4df0-8e1c-1893247d5193/" width="778"/></p>
<p><strong>Objectives</strong></p>
<p>Implement the flowchart above. While doing it, please, follow our recommendations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don't use the built-in functions to calculate from a string;</li>
<li>The <code class="java">result</code> variable must be of the <code class="java">float</code> type;</li>
<li>Copy the message. The tests will check if the correct message appears in the correct order. So don't add extra lines or characters: <code class="java">msg_3 = "Yeah... division by zero. Smart move..."</code></li>
</ul>

<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Enter an equation
&gt; 2 + m
Do you even know what numbers are? Stay focused!
Enter an equation
&gt; 3 n 3
Yes ... an interesting math operation. You've slept through all classes, haven't you?
Enter an equation
&gt; 4 / 0
Yeah... division by zero. Smart move...
Enter an equation
&gt; 4 * 5.2
20.8
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Example 2</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Enter an equation
&gt; 411 - 211
200.0</code></pre></body></html>

<h1>Stage 3</h1>

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>Take a look at the upgraded flowchart. As before, the old blocks are red-colored. Be careful; some flows can now work differently.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" height="2022" name="Stage3.jpg" src="https://ucarecdn.com/4a899d94-c524-48f1-8bfe-04ea9139172b/" width="1016"/></p>
<p><strong>Objectives</strong></p>
<p>To complete this stage, you need to implement the flowchart above. While doing it, please, follow our recommendations below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don't use the built-in function <code class="java">eval()</code> to calculate from a string;</li>
<li>The <code class="java">memory</code> variable must be of a float type;</li>
<li>There are no tests when <code class="java">M</code> is negative. For example, there will be no test input like this: <code class="java">-M + 6</code>;</li>
<li>Copy two messages. The tests will check if the correct message appears in the correct order. Don't add extra lines or characters.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">msg_4 = "Do you want to store the result? (y / n):"

msg_5 = "Do you want to continue calculations? (y / n):"</code></pre>

<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="java">Enter an equation
&gt; 3 + 3
6
Do you want to store the result? (y / n):
&gt;y
Do you want to continue calculations? (y / n):
&gt;y
Enter an equation
&gt; 5 + M
11
Do you want to store the result? (y / n):
&gt;y
Do you want to continue calculations? (y / n):
&gt;n</code></pre></body></html>

<h1>Stage 4</h1>

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>Implement the flowchart below. Take a good look â€” there're two functions. The old blocks are in red. Be careful; some flows can now work differently.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" height="2097" name="Stage4.jpg" src="https://ucarecdn.com/0706cb45-ffba-4f2e-ab19-ab635467da58/" width="1017"/></p>
<p>Functions:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" height="1052" name="Stage4_function.jpg" src="https://ucarecdn.com/74e59427-a12d-4d48-8c7c-29008d46503b/" width="603"/></p>

<p><strong>Objectives</strong></p>
<p>Implement the flowchart with two functions. Please, mind the recommendations below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don't use the built-in function <code class="java">eval()</code> to calculate from a string;</li>
<li>Notice that the function <code class="java">is_one_digit()</code> is supposed to check whether it has an integer value in the <em><strong>mathematical sense</strong></em>, e.g. 3.0 is an integer, 3.1 is a non-integer number. Thus, do <strong>NOT</strong> check the type of variable, but the number itself. You can use a special built-in method <code class="java">.is_integer()</code> on a float variable to check if a number is an integer.</li>
<li>Copy the messages carefully. The tests will check if the correct message appears in the correct order. Don't add extra lines or characters.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="java">msg_6 = " ... lazy"

msg_7 = " ... very lazy"

msg_8 = " ... very, very lazy"

msg_9 = "You are"</code></pre>

<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Enter an equation
&gt; 2 / M
You are ... lazy
Yeah... division by zero. Smart move...
Enter an equation
&gt; 1 * M
You are ... lazy ... very lazy ... very, very lazy
0.0
Do you want to store the result? (y / n):
&gt; n
Do you want to continue calculations? (y / n):
&gt; y
Enter an equation
&gt; 899 * 0
You are ... very, very lazy
0.0
Do you want to store the result? (y / n):
&gt; n
Do you want to continue calculations? (y / n):
&gt; n</code></pre></body></html>

<h1>Stage 5</h1>

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>To complete the project, you need to implement the flowchart below. The old blocks are red-colored. Be careful; some flows can work differently. The functions from the previous stage have not been changed.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" height="2097" name="Stage5.jpg" src="https://ucarecdn.com/5a9953cf-380a-4a12-a88b-bb45edd5e890/" width="1046"/></p>
<p><strong>Objectives</strong></p>
<p>Implement the flowchart. Please, follow the recommendations below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don't use the built-in function <code class="java">eval()</code> to calculate from a string;</li>
<li>Copy the messages below. The tests will check if the correct message appears in the correct order. Don't add extra lines or characters.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="java">msg_10 = "Are you sure? It is only one digit! (y / n)"

msg_11 = "Don't be silly! It's just one number! Add to the memory? (y / n)"

msg_12 = "Last chance! Do you really want to embarrass yourself? (y / n)"</code></pre>

<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Enter an equation
2 + 3
You are ... lazy
5.0
Do you want to store the result? (y / n):
